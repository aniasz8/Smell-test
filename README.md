*About the app and project*

The project's aim was to create an app that can conduct a test and then generate a pdf file with the results. App is in german as 
it was made for a *Smell & Taste Clinic of the Departament of Otorhinolaryngology of the University of Dresden Medical School*.

Project was made in Android Studio. It consists of 6 activities: MainActivity just with a button indicating a new investigation,
patientdata with many Edittexts to insert patient's data, selecttest where one can choose which test to do and three other activities
with particular tests.
In selecttest there are also other options: to see the current score, to reset all the data and go back to MainActivity or to export 
data to pdf file. It is only possible to create a pdf after doing either one test or all three.

App uses the iTextG 5.1.0 library to generate a pdf.
